# Gulp Static Website Starter ðŸ¥¤

My personal starter template for static website development with `Gulp`.  
This starter template uses also `BrowserSync`, `Webpack`, `PostCSS` and `npm`.

## Usage

Install node_modules (initial).
```
npm install
```

Development mode with BrowserSync.

```
gulp serve
```

Build static site generated production build.

```
gulp build
```

Clean the build directory.

```
gulp clean
```

(Optional) Serve your build locally.

```
npx serve _build
```
